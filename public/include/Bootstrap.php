/**
 * Welcome to Dave-Smith Johnson & Son family bank!
 * 
 * This is a tool to assist with scam baiting, especially with scammers attempting to
 * obtain bank information or to attempt to scam you into giving money.
 * 
 * This tool is licensed under the MIT license (copy available here https://opensource.org/licenses/mit), so it
 * is free to use and change for all users. Scam bait as much as you want!
 * 
 * This project is heavily inspired by KitBoga (https://youtube.com/c/kitbogashow) and his LR. Jenkins bank.
 * I thought that was a very cool idea, so I created my own version. Now it's out there for everyone!
 * 
 * Please, waste these people's time as much as possible. It's fun and it does good for everyone.
