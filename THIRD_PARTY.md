## Information

Some works and parts of this project are sourced sourced from public domain sources
and royalty free works databases.

Although we have legal permission to use these works, I believe credit is owed where
credit is due. This document will contain a dictionary of all the copyrighted works included
in this program.

The majority of the content consists of public domain graphics. But, some are licensed under
another licence (most commonly the [Pixabay image licence](https://pixabay.com/service/license/)).
All of these images and other material have been detailed below.

You can find the usage location for these images in the *"assets"* folder in the www-root.

## What to do if you have an issue

If you have an issue with your own or somebody else's content being included in the program and your situation
fits on of the below, please contact us using GitHub pull requests or issues:

1. **My content is not credited in this file!** Please see the note at the top of the file detailing how to get yourself added
1. **I have a copyright issue!** Please submit a GitHub issue. We take copyright seriously, and if your work has been mistaken for public domain, we need to hear about it.

## Database of third-party images

All third party images can be found under the *public/assets* directory. These are all either royalty free or licensed under the [Pixabay Licence](https://pixabay.com/service/license/)

## Database of open source projects

You will find all used open source projects in the following locations:

1. **.gitmodules** This file contains git submodule definitions for all the open source projects used by DSJAS
1. **composer.json** This file contains package definitions for the composer packages DSJAS depends on

## Used frameworks/plugins

You can find files with a name similar to *Bootstrap.php* scattered around the project. These contain include directives for all the frameworks and plugins used on every page. The most important of which are:

* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Popper.JS](https://popper.js.org/)

## In build-in modules/themes

Some builtins use third-party content for their functionality. In this case, they will contain a file which states the sources and licence for them.
