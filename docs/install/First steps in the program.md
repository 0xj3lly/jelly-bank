# Welcome to DSJAS!

If you're coming to this guide, you've probably just installed the program and are faced with this screen:

The text says that you're ready to go, but what now? What can you do with DSJAS now that the install is complete? I'll break down a few of the most common steps first of all.

## Go to the homepage and survey the sights

Clicking the primary blue button on this page will direct you to the homepage. This is where you can see the look and feel of the site.

### Check your finances

> **Login credentials:** When you install the program, some bank accounts are created for a user. This username has the name of *edna* and a default password of *hunter2*

Navigating to *<http://localhost/user/Login.php>* will direct you to the login page. Here, you can login to the patented **My Bank Onlineâ„¢**. After logging in with the credentials named above, you can apply for some accounts. Don't worry, you're already approved, so the process only takes a few seconds.

Now all of that is set up, you can make transfers, cash savings in and pay your taxes!

## Go to the admin dashboard

The other two links on this page are to the admin dashboard. They will both direct you to the login page (assuming you didn't log in already). As this is your first time logging in and using the site, special instructions will be displayed.

In order to log in, you can use the credentials of the *primary administrator* your created in the install process. From there, you can create other users and change site settings.

### Change up the look

One of the main features of DSJAS is that you can make the site look how you want with themes. Themes can be made by you or other users and can be installed with a single click. You can also switch between themes with a click.

There are a couple of themes included by default:

1. **Default theme:** The vanilla look of the site. No thrills but possibly recognizable
1. **Default theme - minimal:** The default theme, but which only consists of a login page and dashboard. Useful if the scammers are quite suspicious of you and might pick up on some of the less-professional looking areas of the site
1. **Felicity Bank:** A ported version of an existing fake bank, in use by many people

You can uninstall all themes except the default theme. So, if you're low on disk space, you can certainly uninstall the minimal and Felicity Bank themes.

### Make stuff difficult

Modules are used to modify how the interface on the client behaves. This could, for example, be used to add a password reset button. However, their main use is to add interchangeable functionality to the site to annoy the scammers attempting to use it.

For example, a module I created (called *An especially frustrating login process*) makes the sign in process very long and difficulty. It does this, for example, by adding many captcha mechanisms and verification questions. This makes the scammers very annoyed and wastes a lot of time - which is the whole point of this baiting.

### Lock down the site

Some scammers are very suspicious of bank sites. Some may even try to check for DSJAS! So, we provide a way of locking down all DSJAS pages to conceal it. This setting makes these pages redirect to a *404* page.

These settings are listed under the **Security settings** section in the general settings tab.

## Get baiting

Call up some scammers and try and get them to fall for DSJAS! It works a surprisingly large proportion of the time, so why not give it a go?
