# DSJAS Usage Disclaimer

DSJAS does include some functionality which could be used maliciously. After all, we are quite literally mimicking a bank site. This, in the wrong hands, could be misused.

I realise that it would be slightly irresponsible to put this software out in the world without some kind of guidelines/usage disclaimer. So, behold, the DSJAS usage disclaimer!

> **This is not legal texts and is not legal binding at all!** Please see the LICENCE file in the project root for the *actual* legal stuff.

## Responsible usage

Although I stand by the promise of free usage given by the MIT licence, I would like to put forward some information on what I consider to be appropriate and responsible usage.

As mentioned earlier, some of DSJAS's features could be abused and used in ways which I didn't intend them. So, I'm putting this out there now: **DSJAS is not scam software; it is designed to be used to waste the time of scammers to make the internet a better place by making scamming less financially effective!**

If you are using this software to steal people's money or scam people out of the banking details, I can't really stop you without compromising the security and privacy of legitimate users (not to mention the integrity of the software). I'm not going to go around trying to sue people because they used my software in a way I don't like or agree with.

In the same way that you *could* use Metasploit to hack somebody's computer-, you *could* use DSJAS to run a scam. **But**, you are responsible for your own actions.

All I can say is, please, only use this software for what it is intended to do: bait scammers and make their illegal operations slightly less financially promising.

## Mimic, don't become

DSJAS is not a real banking system. Our methods for transactions, account storage and authentication are basic and not designed to really stand up in an actual production environment of the one it is pretending to be part of. The DSJAS banking system would be instantly considered insecure if a real bank used it. So, *don't use this as some kind of real banking system* and *don't base your bank code off anything you see in this repository!*

So, use this as a fake bank. Don't use it **as a bank**.

## Don't expose your site

DSJAS isn't designed for use externally, especially not being exposed to the internet. As stated in the install instructions:

> DSJAS is designed to be used **locally only** and is not designed to be installed remotely

If you are planning to install the program remotely, please be careful and don't take any chances with security, access to the admin dashboard or account passwords.
