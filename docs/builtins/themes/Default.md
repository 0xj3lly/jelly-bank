# DSJAS default theme - *the all rounder*

The DSJAS default theme is designed to be a consistent, convincing yet not without humor theme for the stock look of DSJAS. It is the vanilla look of the site.

This default theme is a fleshed out banking site for a bank which **does** have physical branches. In fact, some pages make direct references to this (like the find us page). Therefore, you shouldn't say that the bank is *"all online"* or *"online only"* or something like that.

The login page is as extendable as possible, with places for modules to go everywhere and plenty of room for extension. In addition, it's responsive for any size of bank icon.

## Defining features

A fleshed out site, featuring pages with adverts for upcoming and existing services of the bank. In addition, a mission statement is provided (which just so happens to just be the LPGL from <https://fsf.org>).

In addition, the theme purposefully hides warnings about scams in conspicuous places around the page. This should be a great way to either reveal or make the scammers nervous. However, none are placed in locations that could be a massive giveaway.

I've tried my best to make this theme a solid choice for basic baiting, but it could be spotted; some parts of it just don't look the professional. But, most scammers won't even notice anyways, so you can probably get away with it.

## Use case

* With the majority of non-suspicious scammers
* When you don't have another theme

## Possible giveaways

Some parts of the site don't really look that professional. You can probably get away with them, but suspicious scammers, as mentioned earlier, could point these out and realise the bank is fake.

The navbar at the bottom of the page reads ```Copyright 2019 Black Mesa Inc.``` There is no real company called Black Mesa Inc. (possible owing to the fact that it's just the company out of Half Life). Aware scammers could spot this.

By default, the theme contains no links to the admin panel. You do not have to worry about scammers finding a link to the admin login.

The company policies are just the LGPL reformatted and some of the humor in prominent places in the page could be drawn attention to. However, I've made these somewhat far into the texts, so scammers who don't read the full message will be fine.
