# DSJAS default theme - *the lighter one*

This theme is just the DSJAS default theme but without the fleshing out that the actual default theme does. It only consists of login/out pages and the dashboard. There are no support links and there is no front page.

This theme is ideal for baiting suspicious scammers or those who don't seem to be very patient.

## Defining features

There is no front page, support, contact or services adverts. Most of the easter eggs from the default theme are still present (like CP Rewards), but skimmed down.

Essentially, the bank becomes just a sign-in page and the online banking tools. This makes it ideal for pretending to be an online only bank.

## Use case

* For pretending to be an "online-only" bank
* When the scammer is impatient and annoying
* For suspicious scammers who pick up on small details and mistakes
* When you just don't need the extra stuff the default theme gives you

## Possible giveaways

The bank doesn't really look that fleshed out and is, well, minimal!

Everything said about the default theme also applies here.
