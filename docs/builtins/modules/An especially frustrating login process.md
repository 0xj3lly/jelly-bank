# An especially frustrating login process

    The login process is nice and simple, isn't it? Well, not any longer! This module adds lots and lots of steps to the login process to make scammers' lives hell!

## About

DSJAS's login process is designed to be a blank slate for other things to be added on. This module takes advantage of that feature by adding in many steps and difficult problems in order to make the login process - the first thing you have to do with the scammers on the site - long and frustrating.

One of the redeeming features of a lot of fake bank programs is that they include ridiculous, frustrating features in order to annoy the scammers. This modules adds that functionality.

## What does this module do?

This module adds a popup to the login screen which will appear before the form can be submitted. You will have to complete the steps in the popup before logging in.

For example, here is the math captcha added in one of the steps:

Luckily for you, the extremely difficult questions the captchas ask to "verify you are not a robot" or "resolve a fraud alert" have defined answers which will be accepted regardless of what was being asked. Those defined answers are listed under the usage instructions. For some of them, there are multiple.

## How do I use this module?

This module will be applied automatically to the login screen when enabled. When the popup appears after you click "Log in" on the signin page, follow the instructions in the popup.

Below are the methods and accepted answers for each of the popup types:

### Popups and answers

#### Math captcha

**Regardless of whether you are on the easy question or the hard one** the accepted answers are still the same. This captcha will accept any of the following answers:

* 420
* 69
* 9000

*Yes I know, hilariously funny*

#### Fraud alert security questions

It seems like you picked the most obscure security questions ever when you signed up your account! Luckily, the answers are quite easy to remember

* **What year was your second cat born in?** 1984
* **What street did your childhood neighbor's cousin move to three years after you left home?** Quality street
* **If I called you an idiot, what would your response be?** Is that a personal attack or something?

Please note that the middle answer is **case sensitive!** The "Q" at the beginning of the name must be capitalized for the answer to be accepted. This is, however, not true of the last answer; any capitalized variant of the same text will be accepted. However, the question mark must be present for the answer to be correct.

Cancelling this notice will result in a warning stating that "This incident was reported to the fraud team". **Some scammers will not like this!** Please be cautions when cancelling this variant if the scammer has been particularly nervous or suspicious.

#### Intrusive survey

This variant is the simplest, but also the most comedic when scammers are low on time. To dismiss this popup, all you need to do is type anything into any of the input boxes. The module doesn't check, transmit or store the contents, so it could literally be anything.

You are **required**, however, to input more than 1 character into the box for it to be counted as an answer.

This popup takes time to dismiss as the module "submits the answers". If nothing appears to be happening, don't panic! It's just that feature at work.

### Cancelling

If you cancel the form which appears, most popup variants will reload the page. If it doesn't do that, it will reset the form's contents to blanks.

### Getting an "easier problem"

On popup variants which feature this button, the "easier problem" is, in fact, designed to appear longer and harder. The majority of them are just pseudorandom text from sources such as Wikipedia. For example, the navier-stokes equation page was used in the math captcha variant.

You might only want to do this if the scammer tells you to, as it could be a giveaway.

### Quick dismiss

For special circumstances, it is possible to cancel the popup without reloading or submitting the form. The close button in the top corner will dismiss the popup without reloading the page in the way the cancel button does. This is intentional and is for any circumstances where you need to get rid of the popup quickly. For example, if you mistyped the password and want to correct it.

## Possible giveaways

This module adds the text ```This login form is protected by Frustratingly Good Security (FGS) technology``` to the bottom of the login form. Aware scammers may spot this.

In general, this module could be a giveaway and put-off to aware scammers. Some of the popups less than others. If you think a scammer will be annoyed by a particular popup type, you could just click the cancel button quickly. This will reload the page and generate a new popup.

Please also see the section on "easier problems" on giveaways associated with that.
