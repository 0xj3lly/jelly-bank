# The admin dashboard - *user manual*

Once you have logged in, you will see the admin dashboard. There a few actions you should be familiar with on the admin dashboard.

## The sidebar

The sidebar will contain links to all the important and useful pages of DSJAS.

At the bottom, you will see two links:

1. **Go to site** Inspired by WordPress, this link will direct you to the main page of the site
1. **Logout** Logs your out from the admin dashboard, but **not** the bank

Above this, you will see several menus and links to the various panels of the site. These are labelled self-explanatorily.

## The notifications

When DSJAS needs you to know something, a notification will be popped in this menu. These will be colored according to the severity of the alert and the type of information contained.

### Clearing notifications

Notifications can be cleared by clicking on the clear notifications button. You will then have the page refreshed. All previous notifications will be replaced by a single one telling you notifications will be removed. This will be removed automatically the next time the dashboard is loaded.

## The quick information

This is information which could be valuable to know at a glance during a bait. If you keep the main dashboard open at all times in a different browser, you can see the this information at any time.

This information, however, only updates when the page loads. Please refresh the page to get updated information.

## The quick actions

Sometimes, during a bait, you need to get to doing something fast. The quick actions allow this, with buttons for quickly performing common tasks.

## That's all!

Well done, you've now graduated with a degree in the DSJAS admin panel! Hopefully this feature of the admin dashboard will be useful for you during your baits at some point in the future.
