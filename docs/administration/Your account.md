# Your account - *user manual*

You will notice that, on the sidebar of the admin panel, there is a link to *My Account*. This link takes your to a page allowing you to manage your account and associated information.

## Editing your account information

Clicking on this link will open a page similar to the following:

![Edit user page](https://i.imgur.com/XPHnxBN.png)

On this page you will be able to edit all the information associated with your account.

## Changing your username

Editing your username on the account edit page will cause your login credentials to be changed. You will now be required to sign in with the new username set in this box.

## Changing your real name

Your real name, as stored by DSJAS, is usually just stored and used for things such as greetings on the dashboard and personalized alerts. If this box is left blank, your username will instead be used.

## Email

Although DSJAS doesn't use your email, this is useful if other administrators need to contact you in private.

Changing this does not have any effect on your profile.

## Changing your password

> **Note:** Although you can reset your password on the account edit page, we recommend resetting all passwords via the reset password section in the account settings page

You can reset your own DSJAS password at any time. This is useful for security and when you have forgotten your password.

We recommend resetting the primary administrator and your main account's password every two to three months to prevent guessing.

After resetting your password, you may be signed out for security.

## Changing your password hint

Your password hint is optional and can be left blank. This is displayed when the password for your account has been entered incorrectly. This value **is displayed to anybody who knows your username!** It should never contain anything which gives away your password.

> **Note:** After resetting a password, the associated password hint is set to *Your password was reset*.

## Deleting your account

> **Warning:** This action is permanent and irreversible. You cannot retrieve the details of a deleted account and any associated data (such as notifications or action history) will be permanently discarded. Please be sure before you delete.

You can delete your account from the account settings page. Select your account in the table of users and select *Delete*. You will be asked to confirm. To complete the operation, you **must** then sign out.

## Disabling your account

You are not able to disable the account you are logged in to. If you need to disable the account you are logged in to, create a new, temporary account to disable the current account from.

If you're trying to disable access to the admin panel by disabling all accounts, please instead use the *Allow access to admin panel* setting, defined in the *General* settings tab. This setting disallows access to all admin dashboard pages, including the login.
