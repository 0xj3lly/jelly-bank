# DSJAS administration - *user manual*

So, you want to become a competent administrator on a DSJAS site, do you? Well, great news for you, because it's not really that hard.

DSJAS includes an easy-to-learn and easy-to-master administration panel which is fully graphical and requires no fiddling around with server configs or other low-level stuff. DSJAS handles it all for you.

The best part is, unless you intentionally try, there's not many ways to break things. DSJAS prevents dangerous actions, such as disabling or deleting your own account, and flatly refuses to do some operations which would break the site (such as uninstalling the default theme).

So, all you need to know are some basic operations for using the admin panel.
