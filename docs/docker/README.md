# DSJAS+Docker - *user manual*

DSJAS ships with docker support in order to simplify the process of installing the site. Not only do docker containers come with a configured database - they also come installed with good defaults. This means that running the installer isn't necessary.

Rather than a 5-10 minute installer, you can get started with the site in 1-2 commands.

Docker is really convenient and great for all DSJAS users.
