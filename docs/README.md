# DSJAS documentation

**Hey there, and welcome to the Official DSJAS Wiki and Documentation** - DSJASWAD for short (yeah, not really).
This is the place you will find information from both the community and developers on how the site works, how the numerous components fit together and how you can use this software to its fullest potential.

**For some quick info, please read the FAQ! You can find it in this folder under *FAQ.md***

## For users

The documentation contains lots of useful and interesting pieces of information for users of the software to learn DSJAS or just to get better at general usage.

In general, most of the information for users is aimed at people who are attempting to learn the software as a beginner. However, there are plenty of pieces of advice for advanced users also.

If you have a question or issue about the site, this is probably the place to resolve it.

## For developers

For the most part, this documentation is designed for developers more than regular users. The DSJAS API can be incredibly overwhelming for a beginner (especially a beginner to extension APIs in general).

So, I think it is incredibly important that I provide a great amount of detail and explain everything that you could ever need to know. After all, you need to understand the site before you can make it better!

If you're interested in developing a theme, the API will be extensively documented here, as well as common issues/pitfalls and ways of getting started. On top of all this, the wiki is community maintained, meaning that any person with a problem or workaround for a problem; important information to share with the community or a cool use case for the API can contribute what they have to say.

## Getting started

The documentation is organized into folders which contain information about each respective subject as relating to the site. For example, site administration information is located under the *administration* directory, and plugin development is located under the *plugin* directory. This way, when looking for information about a specific topic, you can just look into each directory.

In addition, an index of files (along with brief descriptions) is provided in the *Index.md* file of each directory. On sites such as GitHub, this page will be displayed at the bottom of each page.

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute to the documentation, you can do a couple of things:

1. **Submit an issue with the "documentation-request" tag:** Use this to request documentation of a feature to be added by maintainers

2. **Submit a Pull Request with the "documentation" tag:** Use this to directly improve, modify, update or add to documentation

3. **Contribute to GitHub wiki:** This is the place that most users will land when looking for help, so important changes should be propagated there first.
